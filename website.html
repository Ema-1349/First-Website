<h1>Emma Dong</h1>

<p>Hai, my name is Emma Dong. I've been taking ballet RAD exams since I was 5 years old. This year I'm studying Intermediate and the exam will be in June. The exam levels go by : Primary, Gr1, Gr2..... Gr 8, Intermediate Foundation, Intermediate...</p>

<p>I dont normally have time to play video games as my mom doesnt care about anything else apart for my academics. She's even forbidden reading at home as I read too much. Instead, my mom made me spend this winter break preparing for the upcoming Pascal math contest in school.</p>
